    <title>IT Ethics </title>
</style>
</head>
<body>
	<h3>IT ethics refers to the moral principles and guidelines that govern the use of information technology. 
	As technology continues to advance rapidly, issues related to privacy, security, intellectual property, 
	and the social impact of technology arise, requiring ethical consideration.
	IT ethics addresses questions about how technology should be used responsibly and the consequences of its misuse. <h3>
	
    <h2>Privacy and Misuse of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>The ethical use of personal data, including issues related to data collection, storage, and sharing. 
	Organizations must respect individuals' privacy rights and ensure data is handled securely.</p>
	<p> How often do you peruse the internet, make a purchase, fill out surveys and forms, and use social media? Companies gather your information to personalize your online experience and provide targeted advertising. But how much information gathering is too much?
	“Think about the use of drones in search and rescue,” Ferebee says. “While the drones are flying, they are recording videos of their surroundings. What happens to that video of private property and the people on that property? How is it stored and used?”
	So far, five states have enacted more comprehensive consumer data privacy laws — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia — with eight more states set to join them by 2026 — Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, and Texas. “We’re going to see more and more states adopting stricter consumer data privacy laws,” Ferebee says.</p>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Protecting information systems from unauthorized access, breaches, or cyberattacks is a fundamental aspect of IT ethics, and it involves the careful implementation of a variety of security measures and protocols to safeguard sensitive data and systems from malicious actors. Ethical IT practices require organizations to adopt a proactive and comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, ensuring that their digital infrastructure is resilient to threats and vulnerabilities that could jeopardize the privacy, integrity, and availability of information..</p>
    
    <h2>Cybersecurity  </h2>
    <p> Ethical considerations surrounding activities such as hacking, data breaches, and cyberattacks are crucial in understanding the balance between securing systems and respecting legal and moral boundaries. While hacking is often associated with malicious activities, there is a clear distinction between ethical hacking and malicious hacking, each having its own set of ethical implications.</p>
    
    <h2>Environmental impact of IT</h2>
    <p>Nearly every U.S. state contains at least one data center, the World Economic Forum reports. According to the Department of Energy, they account for approximately 2% of the total U.S. electricity use. As an example of the enormous size of these centers, data centers in Loudoun, Virginia, use 25 million square feet with another 4 million in development.
	“There are data centers that take up vast swaths of land and consume large amounts of energy. From an ethical standpoint, we have to consider the environmental impact of these data centers,” Ferebee says.</p>
